# Contributing
When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, 
or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Pull Request (PR) Process
- We expect users to use branches or forks (whichever is more convenient and advised by your project lead). 
- Any change made by any authority other than the project lead must be approved by **at least two other active
maintainers with admin privledges**. 
- Project leads must follow this procedure when making significant changes 
to the codebase of their project. *Admins are not exempt from this process*.

### Branches
1. Create a new branch with the title of the **change you are making**. We want these branches to be descriptive in case
someone else wants to add onto an existing branch.
2. Clone the appropriate branch using the command `git clone -b <branch> <remote_repo>`

### Forks
Forks follow a similar process to branches except for the initialization.
1. Fork the project
2. Clone and make changes to your forked repository

### Making a PR
- Once your changes are complete, navigate to the `Pull Request` tab of your project in GitHub and make a PR
**from your branch to the intended branch** (usually main, ask your project lead if you are uncertain). 

- Be sure to include the statement `closes <issue #>` in your PR to link it to the appropriate issue
and update any project workflows.

## Documentation
Any issues, documentation, or PRs you make should be thoroughly documented and 
inspected for errors. 
1. All issues should attempt to answer all of the questions in the issues text field
2. All PRs should attempt to document the exact functionality of the PR
3. All documentation should be intentionally and carefully worded to reflect 
the intent of the documentation (usually to inform the reader)

Good luck, and have fun!
